I am currently a first year MS student at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, majoring in Computer Science. From 2019-2023, I conducted my undergraduate studies at the Glasgow School of the University of Electronic Science and Technology (UST), specialising in Electronic Information Engineering. During this period, I have been awarded several first-class scholarships for outstanding students. My main research interest in this phase is in recommender systems, especially session-based recommendations. In 2023, I started my MS degree in the State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Collaborative Computing Technology, and my main research interest is in large language model.
